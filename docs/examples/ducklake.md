# DuckLake

## Overview

::: metaxy-example source-link
    example: ducklake

This example demonstrates how to run a small Metaxy pipeline against a [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/) attachment on the DuckDB metadata store.
DuckLake is an open lakehouse format that separates the metadata catalog (table definitions, schema evolution, and transaction history) from data file storage.
This lets you choose independent backends for each layer, for example PostgreSQL for the catalog and S3 for data files. The example keeps the Metaxy workflow minimal, then uses `SHOW ALL TABLES` to inspect what DuckLake created after a successful write.

Available backend combinations:

| Catalog backend | Storage backend |
|---|---|
| DuckDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL | local filesystem, S3, Cloudflare R2, Google Cloud Storage |
| MotherDuck | managed (no storage backend needed), or BYOB with S3/R2/GCS |

!!! tip

    To use the credential chain (IAM roles, environment variables, etc.) instead of static credentials, set `secret_parameters = { provider = "credential_chain" }` on S3, R2, or GCS storage backends.

!!! note

    MotherDuck supports a "Bring Your Own Bucket" (BYOB) mode where MotherDuck manages the DuckLake catalog while you provide your own S3-compatible storage. Storage secrets are created `IN MOTHERDUCK` so that MotherDuck compute can access your bucket.

## Getting Started

Install the example's dependencies:

```shell
uv sync
```

For the full list of backend combinations and advanced options, see the [DuckLake integration reference](../integrations/metadata-stores/storage/ducklake.md).

## Step 1: Configure DuckLake

DuckLake is configured with two parts:

1. **Catalog backend**: transaction log and metadata
2. **Storage backend**: data files

The example below is intentionally minimal and runnable out of the box.

```toml title="metaxy.toml"
--8<-- "example-ducklake/metaxy.toml"
```

## Step 2: Initial Run

Run a small Metaxy pipeline against the configured store:

```python title="src/example_ducklake/pipeline.py"
--8<-- "example-ducklake/src/example_ducklake/pipeline.py"
```

```shell
uv run python src/example_ducklake/pipeline.py
```

## Step 3: Inspect DuckLake Tables

::: metaxy-example output
    example: ducklake
    scenario: "DuckLake pipeline run"
    step: "run_demo"

You should see:

1. A successful Metaxy write
2. The DuckLake catalog tables from `SHOW ALL TABLES`
3. The actual feature table Metaxy created for `examples/ducklake_demo`
